** note: H/W of an individual canyon can be calculated by:
   H/W = sqrt(lpin)*bh_o_bl/(1-sqrt(lpin))  (ALTHOUGH, the model will
   increase the resolution if it is too low for any given facet, and
   this may result in the lambdap, bh_o_bl, or H/W ratios that you want
   not being met exactly

Explanation of the parameters:

* note: 'roads' and 'streets' are used interchangeably

c model/integration parameters
VFCALC: if vfcalc=0 (means no vf calcs) the file "vfinfo.dat" with
the correct view factor info must be in the run directory;
vfcalc=1 means exact plane parallel view factor calcs;
vfcalc=2 means contour integration view factor calcs; ** note: vfcalc
must be 1 or 2 if looping through lambdap is turned on (i.e. numlp>1)
YD: julian day (affects diurnal evolution of solar angle). In case of 
using TMY File it must be equal to the julian date of the first day 
in TMY file (=1 for Jan 1st).
DELTAT: (seconds) input timestep - will be reduced by the model if needed
 - a large number (e.g. 999.) will ensure that the model controls the
timestep (recommended) - the model is optimized to find the largest
timestep (therefore the fastest run time) that is still stable at any
given time during the simulation
OUTPT_TM: (hours) how often model outputs are written
TMYData: Number of data in TMY file. (TMYData/24 = number of days in TMY file)
MaxDay: Number of days to be simulated (Maximum number for day iteration)
TTHRESHOLD: (deg C) accuracy of Newton's method in solving the patch
energy balances - the smaller the number the higher the accuracy
FACET_OUT: 'T' = write out individual patch surface temperatures organized
by facet; 'F' = do not write out these files
MATLAB_OUT: 'T' = write out files containing patch vertices and patch faces,
as well as patch surface temperature (Tsfc), patch brightness temperature
(Tbright), and patch net shortwave (Kstar); these three quantities can then
be easily visualized in Matlab with the 'patch' command; 'F' - do not write
these files
SUM_OUT: 'T' = write out individual patch surface temperatures (Tsfc) and
patch brightness temperature (Tbright) organized by TUF3D loop order (facet
direction varies slowest, then z, then y, then x) - so as to be easily read
in and assigned to the equivalent geometry (in the SUM model for example);
'F' = do not write out these files
GRASS: 'T' = Vegetated ground surface with Bowen ratio specified later
N_Window: 'T' = there is a window on north wall, 'F' = there is no window
S_Window,W_Window,E_Window: the same as N_Window
Bowen_ratio: Bowen ratio which is the ratio of sensible heat flux to 
latent heat flux. 

c radiative parameters
DALB: (W/m2) accuracy to which the effective albedo/emissivity of the
canyon/cavity portion of the domain will be calculated; that is,
reflections will continue until the change in albedo between timesteps
is less than "dalb"
ALBR,ALBS,ALBW: albedo of roof, street and wall patches, respectively
EMISR,EMISS,EMISW,EMISG: emissivity of roof, street, wall, and glass 
patches, respectively

c Window difffuse properties (Maxium 3 window layers are allowed)
c if #layers less than 3, input zero for the rest
c Note: window part is based on ASHRAE Toolkit.
SHGC_diff:   Diffuse SHGC,
trans_diff:  Diffuse transmittance,
absbg_diff1: Diffuse absorptance of layer #1 (1st window pane),
absbg_diff2: Diffuse absorptance of layer #2 (2nd window pane),
absbg_diff3: Diffuse absorptance of layer #3 (3rd window pane),

c Window direct properties (Maxium 3 window layers are allowed)
c if #layers less than 3, input zero for the rest
NumAngle: Number of incident angles measured from normal (degree)
delta_angle: Difference between each two incident angles; Incident angles are 
from 0 to 90 degrees (e.g. for 10 incident angle: 
'0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90' in degree)
SHGC_ang: SHGC corresponding to incident angles 1 to NumAngle
absbg_ang1: absorptance for layer #1 corresponding to incident angles 1 to NumAngle
absbg_ang2: absorptance for layer #2 corresponding to incident angles 1 to NumAngle
absbg_ang3: absorptance for layer #3 corresponding to incident angles 1 to NumAngle
trans_ang: transmittance corresponding to incident angles 1 to NumAngle

c convection parameters
ASHRAE_ExterConvMethods: 'T'=using one of the ASHRAE suggested methods for 
calculating exterior convection coefficient:'CalcHcOutByBLASTmodel' OR 
'CalcHcOutByTARPmodel' OR 'CalcHcOutByMoWiTTmodel' OR 'CalcHcOutByDOE2model'
'F'=using the method suggested in TUF3D.
Z0: input town (i.e. overall) roughness length - model calculates it
according to Macdonald (1998) if values is less than 0
LAMBDAF: input town (i.e. overall) frontal area to plan area ratio
 - model calculates it if values is less than 0, and the model formula
depends on wind direction
ZROOFFRC: (m) the height above roof level for variables (temp, wind) used
to in forcing convection from roofs - model calculates it if the value
is negative 
Z0ROOFM,Z0ROADM: (m) roof and road momentum roughness lengths, respectively
Z0ROOFH,Z0ROADH: (m) roof and road thermal roughness lengths, respectively
 - if values are negative model defaults to 1/200 of corresponding
momentum roughness lengths - **note that ratio of momentum to thermal
roughness lengths should never be smaller than 1/200! **
MOH: ratio of momentum to thermal roughness lengths for transfer from
individual *surfaces* only
RW: wall roughness relative to concrete (rw=1)

W_RoughIndex,S_RoughIndex,R_RoughIndex,window_RoughIndex: Roughness index for
wall, street, roof and window patches respectively.
Terrain: used in convection coeff. calculation.

c domain geometry
BUILDHT_M: (m) height of buildings (mean height, if there is variation)
ZREF: (m) height of measured forcing data (wind speed, air temperature)
 - must be greater than 'buildht_m'
MINRES: minimum resolution of any given facet (i.e. roof, road, or wall)
 - recommended value is 4 or greater (6 is ideal); resolution of all
other facets will be adjusted to maintain all geometric ratios while
ensuring that all facets have a minimum of 'minres' patches across them
in both dimensions (NOTE: THIS IS THE KEY PARAMETER THAT CONTROLS THE
ACCURACY OF THE RADIATION SCHEME VS. THE COMPUTATIONAL EXPENSE -
minres = 2 will give a quick estimate, minres = 4 tends to be a reasonable
balance between speed and accuracy, and minres = 6 tends to give very
accurate results but can be very computationally expensive and can require 
a lot of memory, relative to the speed and memory of a typical desktop;
it is also useful to remember that the minimum resolution for solar
radiation absorption is effectively 2*minres - see the BLM paper for an
explanation)

and starting point of window width from wall's left edge, respectively

walls,and glass, respectively)
TINTW: (deg C) constant building internal air temperature (base of roofs
and walls)

directions) initial, loop interval, and final street orientation
orientation
XLAT_IN,XLATINT,XLATMAX: (degrees) initial, loop interval, and final
latitude

simulate for each lambdap

HVAC system with floating temperature (from ASHRAE method)
DualSetpointSys:if it is TRUE then we have a 
HVAC system with dual setpoint thermostat with deadband between MinSetpoint 
and MaxSetpoint
MinSetpoint(C):If inside air temperature less than this value HVAC sys works in its heating mode
