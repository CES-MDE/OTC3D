# Outdoor Thermal Comfort in 3D (OTC3D) 
## Description 
**Outdoor Thermal Comfort in 3D** is a numerical model for calculating the *spatial variability* of outdoor thermal comfort (OTC), described by a comprehensive thermal comfort metric (currently *Standard Effective Temperature*), in urban areas. This study employs a modular approach, that can be used in combination with existing microclimate simulations, in order to comprehensively and accurately investigates the effects of the built environment.

The model can 

- solving the drag and vertical diffusion in a column for a neutral case. This model is based on Santiago and Martilli 2010 and modified by Nazarian et al. 2017 (fortcoming) using the Large Eddy Simulation results. 

## Motivations
1) Improving the parameterization of turbulent length scale by employing a more accurate turbulence model of atmospheric flow (LES vs RANS). 
2) Integrating the parameterization of dispersive stress in the 1D model.
