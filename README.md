# Outdoor Thermal Comfort in 3D (OTC3D) 
## Description 
**Outdoor Thermal Comfort in 3D** is a numerical model for calculating the *spatial variability* of outdoor thermal comfort (OTC), described by a comprehensive thermal comfort metric (currently *Standard Effective Temperature*), in urban areas. In order to comprehensively and accurately investigates urban microclimate, this study employs a modular approach, such that OTC3D can be used in combination with existing microclimate tools of urban flow and energy analysis. 

## Motivations
1) Desribing outdoor thermal comfort with comrepehsive metrics that integrate air temperature and humidity, as well
as more complex factors such as solar radiation and wind speed, all interactting with
the bodyâ€™s thermal regulation processes.

2) Integrating the parameterization of dispersive stress in the 1D model.
